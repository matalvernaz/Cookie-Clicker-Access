# Cookie Clicker Access - Changelog

## Version 13.9

### Building mute and unmute (previously a one-way trap)
- Building Mute buttons are now labeled and keyboard accessible (e.g. "Mute Grandma"). A code path matched the wrong case and never labeled them, so muting was only possible by accident.
- Muting a building now announces what happened and where to find the Unmute control.
- The muted-buildings strip is no longer hidden from screen readers: each muted building exposes an "Unmute <building>" button there, reachable with Tab, and it leaves the tab order automatically when the building is unmuted. Previously the only way to unmute was disabling the mod.
- Removed dead code that targeted a mute element that does not exist in current game builds.

### Web version
- Minigame container lookups now fall back to the web build's rowSpecial ids (Steam uses row<id>minigame). Restores the minigame header enhancements on the browser/Tampermonkey version.

## Version 13.8

- Simplified milk display under big cookie to show just rank and type (detailed info already in stats menu)
- Fixed sugar lump harvest announcements by wrapping Game.clickLump directly instead of using setTimeout
- Pantheon: slot labels now show only the active tier's effect plus dynamic info (e.g. Cyclius current bonus)
- Pantheon: spirit effects listed per slot tier (Diamond, Ruby, Jade) on separate lines for easy navigation
- Pantheon: simplified slot button labels and "slot already occupied" feedback

## Version 13.7

### Garden Grid Navigation
- Replaced tab-based garden navigation with a proper arrow key grid
- Grid uses `role="grid"` with rows and cells, navigable with arrow keys in NVDA focus mode
- Tab enters the grid at the top-left plot
- Grid size shown in the Plots heading (e.g. "Plots (6 by 6)")
